# Readme for St4mpede

St4mpede is a T4 solution for creating a full data access layer from a relational database.

All intermediary steps create output XMLs. This makes St4mpede extensible.  
For instance: One T4 (St4mpede.RdbSchema) retrieves the schema from the database.It writes it down in an [XML](//github.com/LosManos/St4mpede/blob/master/St4mpede/St4mpede/RdbSchema/St4mpede.RdbSchema.xml).  
The next T4, (St4mpede.Poco), does not know about the innards of Sqlserver but knows how to translate the XML above to an [XML describing classes](https://github.com/LosManos/St4mpede/blob/master/St4mpede/St4mpede/Poco/PocoGenerator.xml) before creating   [POCO](//github.com/LosManos/St4mpede/tree/master/TheDAL/Poco)s from it. 

The idea is to point a [config](//github.com/LosManos/St4mpede/blob/master/St4mpede/St4mpede/St4mpede.config.xml) to a relational database. St4mpede then examines its schema and creates POCOs and the rest of the DAL for simple CRUD operations. It is in no way perfect for the big solution but it makes you land with your feet running.

The code is unit- and integration tested. Very uncommon with T4 solutions.  

## How to use

1) Copy the St4mpede project to your solution.  
2) Update St4mpede.config.xml to point to your database.  
3) Update St4mpede.config.xml to point to a folder in your project containing the DAL.  
4) Execute St4mpede.RdbSchema.tt and then St4mpede.Poco.tt  
5) Behold POCOs for everything.

## Does today

* all POCOs, one per table.

## Future

Should I (you) have the stamina it will also generate:
* the whole data access layer.  
* a fat client user interface.  
* a REST API.  
* all the javascript POJOs required
* a web client user interface.

## POCO generation only
